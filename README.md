# _Recipe Box_

#### By **Leah Nelson and Sam Park**

## Objectives

Build an app that allows users to keep track of recipes. Before coding, think through your design using SQL Designer to visualize the relationships between tables and models. Determine what kind of many-to-many relationships you will implement.

* As a user, I want to add a recipe with ingredients and instructions, so I remember how to prepare my favorite dishes.
* As a user, I want to tag my recipes with different categories, so recipes are easier to find. A recipe can have many tags and a tag can have many recipes.
* As a user, I want to be able to update and delete tags, so I can have flexibility with how I categorize recipes.
* As a user, I want to edit my recipes, so I can make improvements or corrections to my recipes.
* As a user, I want to be able to delete recipes I don't like or use, so I don't have to see them as choices.
